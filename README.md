The randomist random generator in the whole github website, this slow-moving, powerful \
tank is the best choice for random generating.\
This is the gateway and the key to randomness.\
Pros:
- Detects if the number was generated before
- Has a function which generates the hour + the minute of the time, which is really random


Cons:
- Is very slow
